# Laser Control
Laser pointers are now useful and can do amazing things if you just try.

## How To Use?
1. Find or buy a laser pointer
2. Point it to the turret, landmine or someone.

- If you point it to turret - the turret will be offline for 5 seconds
- If you point it to landmine - the landmine will explode
- If you point to somewhere else around the facility - the turret will shoot in that direction (mouse right click to shoot)

## This mod can do:
- Can control turret (shoot and control direction)
- Can turn off turrets for few seconds
- Buyable item via ship's store
- Battery running low faster than usual while controlling turrets, etc
- Laser pointer configuration for host
- Can detonate landmines

## Configuration
You can set in the mod configuration if you want to be able to buy laser pointers via the store or use all mod features (as some are not yet stable)
