# Laser Control
Binding the laser pointer to the turret. What bad things could happen?

## How To Use?
1. Find or buy a pointer laser
2. Point it to the turret body or to someone

- If you point it to the body - the turret will be offline for 5 seconds
- If you point to somewhere else around the facility - the turret will shoot in this direction

## THIS MOD IS IN BETA PHASE
So this mod is in the beta phase, which means it might not be stable enough with other mods or have some issues. You can feel free to contribute by forking the repo, giving feedback and reporting issues. 

## Configuration
You can set in the mod configuration if you want to be able to buy laser pointers via the store or use all mod features (as some are not yet stable)
