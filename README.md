# Laser Control
Binding the laser pointer to the turret. What bad things could happen?

## How To Use?
1. Find a pointer laser
2. Point it to the turret body or to someone

- If you point it to the body - turret will be offline for 5 seconds
- If you point to somewhere else around the facility - turret will shoot to this direction
