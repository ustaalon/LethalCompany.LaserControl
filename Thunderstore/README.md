# Laser Control
Binding the laser pointer to the turret. What bad things could happen?

## How To Use?
1. Find or buy a pointer laser
2. Point it to the turret body or to someone

- If you point it to the body - the turret will be offline for 5 seconds
- If you point to somewhere else around the facility - the turret will shoot in this direction

## This mod can do:
- Can control turret (shoot and control direction)
- Can turn off turrets for few seconds
- Buyable item via ship's store
- Battery running low faster than usual while controlling turrets, etc
- Laser pointer configuration for host
- Can detonate landmines

## Configuration
You can set in the mod configuration if you want to be able to buy laser pointers via the store or use all mod features (as some are not yet stable)
